# Roadmap

`cxcli` is in active development. The core product is functioning.

Our goal with the tool is to prove that there's market fit for a solution like this, and if so, we'll invest more time in automation, user experience, more features.

For now, if you're interested in participating and giving feedback, we believe `cxcli` already solves pain at this stage.
