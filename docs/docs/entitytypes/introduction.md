# Entity types

## What is this?

<!-- An agent in Dialogflow CX is the entity that handles all the conversations that we have defined on the Dialogflow CX console with the end users.

An agent is basically an assistant that will manage the state of each user's conversation when the end users are interacting with the agent through text or audio in multiple channels. -->

With the `cxcli` you can interact easily with your Dialogflow CX entity types.

All the commands that you have available in the `cxcli` to interact with your agents are located down the `cxcli entity-type` command.
