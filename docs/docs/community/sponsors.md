# Sponsors

Do you or your company use cxcli?
You can help keep the project bug-free and feature rich by sponsoring the
project and its maintainers.

## GitHub Sponsors

GitHub Sponsors is a great way to contribute directly to the main maintainer,
[xavidop](https://github.com/xavidop).

This money usually goes to buying coffee, beer, better hardware, and, hopefully,
one day, paying the bills.

You can sponsor and see who's sponsoring Xavier Portilla Edo [here](https://github.com/sponsors/xavidop).


## OpenCollective

OpenCollective is a great way to send some money towards the cxcli
tool.

This ultimately is used to buy/renew domains, keep servers up, print and send
stickers to contributors and users, among other things.

You can start sponsoring at the [OpenCollective
website](https://opencollective.com/cxcli).

Below you can see a list of the current sponsors and backers on OpenCollective:
